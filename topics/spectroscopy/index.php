				The study of the interactions between light and matter is called Spectroscopy. More specifically, spectroscopy is the identification of molecules by analysis of the interaction between electromagnetic radiation and matter in its different states. These interactions may include electronic excitations, molecular vibrations, or nuclear spin orientations. Spectroscopy is useful to organic chemists because it can be used for the identification of unknown compounds and analysis of reaction products. Less than one hundred years ago, structural determination was a difficult and time-consuming task. It was not uncommon for a chemist to spend years determining the structure of an unknown compound. The advent of modern spectroscopy techniques completely transformed the field of chemistry, and structures can now be determined in several minutes.

					Infrared Spectroscopy (Vibrational Spectroscopy) is based on the the exposure of a compound to an infrared source. For every bond in a molecule, the energy gap between vibrational states is dependent on the nature of the bond. Each bond will absorb a different frequency, allowing us to determine which types of bonds are present in a compound. Simply irradiate the compound with all frequencies of IR radiation and then detect which frequencies were absorbed. Specifically, IR spectroscopy can be used to identify the presence of functional groups in a compound. Understanding how to analyze the results of IR spectroscopy is useful in organic chemistry because it can be used to identify reaction products and unknown compounds.

					An IR spectrometer measures the percent transmittance as a function of frequency.

					This plot is called an absorption spectrum.

				The frequency is most commonly measured using wavenumber (á¹½) for easy referencing.
