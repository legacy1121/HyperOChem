			<p>The <i>change in enthalpy</i> (&Delta;H) for any process is defined as the exchange of kinetic energy, also called heat (q), between a system and its surroundings under conditions of constant pressure. This is primarily under conditions where the bond is broken homolytically. Homolytic bond cleavage yields two <i>radicals</i>, which are uncharged species, each of which bears an unpaired electron. Heterolytic bond cleavage yields two charged ions, one (+)  and one (-) charge. <i>Bond dissociation energy</i> is the energy required to break a covalent bond via homolytic bond cleavage.</p>
			<p><i>Heat of reaction</i> is the total change in enthalpy (&Delta;H<sup>o</sup>) for the reaction. If &Delta;H<sup>o</sup> is negative, then the process is exothermic, meaning that the reaction releases energy (heat) into the surroundings, while a positive &Delta;H<sup>o</sup> indicates that the reaction is endothermic and receives energy (heat) from the surroundings.</p>
			<p><i>Entropy</i> is informally defined as the measure of disorder associated with a system. A process is <i>spontaneous</i> that involves an increase in entropy, meaning the products are favored; this does not relate to reaction speed. <i>Gibbs Free Energy</i> (&Delta;G) is a thermodynamic quantity equal to the enthalpy (of a system or process) minus the product of the entropy and the absolute temperature (&Delta;G = &Delta;H + T&Delta;S). If &Delta;G is negative, then the reaction is spontaneous (<i>exergonic</i>), but if &Delta;G is positive, then the reaction is nonspontaneous (<i>endergonic</i>) and favors the reverse reaction. For a reaction, <i>equilibria</i> is a state in which there is no longer an observable change in concentrations of reactants and products (all present in solution).</p>
			<p><i>Kinetics</i> is the area of study that refers to the rate of reactions. Reaction rate tends to increase with concentration.</p>

			<p>The <i>Factors Affecting Rate</i> are: <i>Energy of Activation</i> (E<sub>a</sub>), the energy barrier between the reactants and the products that represents the minimum amount of energy required for a reaction to occur between two reactants, <i>Temperature</i> of a reaction, which will cause the rate to increase or decrease, because the molecules will have more or less kinetic energy and will collide more or less often, and <i>Steric Considerations</i>. A <i>catalyst</i> is a compound that can speed up the rate of a reaction without itself being consumed by the reaction; it does this by altering the mechanism by which the reaction occurs and therefore making the slowest step occur more quickly.</p>
			<p>A <i>Transition State</i> is a non-isolatable state in-between reactants and products:</p>

			<p>An <i>Intermediate</i> is a molecular entity that is formed from the reactants and reacts further to give observed products of a chemical reaction.</p>

			<p class='subtitle'>Nucleophiles and Electrophiles</p>
			<p>An <i>ionic reaction</i> involves ions as reactants, intermediates or products; also known as a polar reaction, the ions are typically intermediates. The two reactants can be classified as a nucleophile and an electrophile. <i>Electrophiles</i> are characterized by their ability to react with a negative charge while <i>nucleophiles</i> are characterized by their ability to react with a positive charge. The strength of a nucleophile is affected by many different factors, especially <i>polarizability</i>: the ability of an atom to distribute its electron density unevenly.</p>

			<i>Nucleophilic Attack</i> - A nucleophilic attack is the process in which a nucleophile “attacks” an electrophile. This happens when the negatively charged nucleophile is attracted to a positively charged nucleus and uses its negative charge to form a bond with the positively charged nucleus.</p>

			<p><i>Loss of Leaving Group</i> - The loss of a leaving group occurs when a chemical bond between the main molecule and its substituent chain is broken and the electrons that make up the bond go to the leaving group, giving it a negative charge.</p>

			<p><i>Proton Transfer</i> - Two electrons are transferred from an R-H bond to the R group, while the H leaves and binds to a separate molecule, with the final result being the movement of an H<sup>+</sup> from one molecule to another.</p>

			<p><i>Carbocation Rearrangement</i> - Movement of either a carbon or hydrogen from one carbon to another on the carbon chain to transfer positive charge to a more stable position. The goal is to move the positive charge to the carbon with the most constituents. One constituent on the charged carbon is known as primary, two is secondary, and third is tertiary. Hydrogen transfer is known as a hydride shift and a carbon transfer is known as a methyl shift. Transfers can only occur between adjacent carbons, but more than one can occur in a single reaction.</p>
