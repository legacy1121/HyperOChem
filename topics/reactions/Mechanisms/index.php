			<p>The <i>change in enthalpy</i> (&Delta;H) for any process is defined as the exchange of kinetic energy, also called heat (q), between a system and its surroundings under conditions of constant pressure. This is primarily under conditions where the bond is broken homolytically. Homolytic bond cleavage yields two <i>radicals</i>, which are uncharged species, each of which bears an unpaired electron. Heterolytic bond cleavage yields two charged ions, one (+)  and one (-) charge. <i>Bond dissociation energy</i> is the energy required to break a covalent bond via homolytic bond cleavage.</p>
			<p><i>Heat of reaction</i> is the total change in enthalpy (&Delta;H<sup>o</sup>) for the reaction. If &Delta;H<sup>o</sup> is negative, then the process is exothermic, meaning that the reaction releases energy (heat) into the surroundings, while a positive &Delta;H<sup>o</sup> indicates that the reaction is endothermic and receives energy (heat) from the surroundings.</p>
			<p><i>Entropy</i> is informally defined as the measure of disorder associated with a system. A process is <i>spontaneous</i> that involves an increase in entropy, meaning the products are favored; this does not relate to reaction speed. <i>Gibbs Free Energy</i> (&Delta;G) is a thermodynamic quantity equal to the enthalpy (of a system or process) minus the product of the entropy and the absolute temperature (&Delta;G = &Delta;H + T&Delta;S). If &Delta;G is negative, then the reaction is spontaneous (<i>exergonic</i>), but if &Delta;G is positive, then the reaction is nonspontaneous (<i>endergonic</i>) and favors the reverse reaction. For a reaction, <i>equilibria</i> is a state in which there is no longer an observable change in concentrations of reactants and products (all present in solution).</p>
			<p><i>Kinetics</i> is the area of study that refers to the rate of reactions. Reaction rate tends to increase with concentration.</p>

			<p>The <i>Factors Affecting Rate</i> are: <i>Energy of Activation</i> (E<sub>a</sub>), the energy barrier between the reactants and the products that represents the minimum amount of energy required for a reaction to occur between two reactants, <i>Temperature</i> of a reaction, which will cause the rate to increase or decrease, because the molecules will have more or less kinetic energy and will collide more or less often, and <i>Steric Considerations</i>. A <i>catalyst</i> is a compound that can speed up the rate of a reaction without itself being consumed by the reaction; it does this by altering the mechanism by which the reaction occurs and therefore making the slowest step occur more quickly.</p>
			<p>A <i>Transition State</i> is a non-isolatable state in-between reactants and products:</p>

			<p>An <i>Intermediate</i> is a molecular entity that is formed from the reactants and reacts further to give observed products of a chemical reaction.</p>
