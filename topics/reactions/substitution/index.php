			<p>A <i>Substitution Reaction</i> is a reaction in which one substituent group is exchanged for another. It can occur when a suitable electrophile is treated with a nucleophile. The electrophile in a substitution reaction is known as the <i>substrate</i>. Haloalkane, Alkyl Halide, and Organohalide are all names for a halogen (that can easily act as a leaving group) which is attached to an alkane; it is classified as primary, secondary, or tertiary based on number of substituents.</p>

			<p class='subtitle'>The S<sub>N</sub>2 Mechanism</p>
			<p>The S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction involves two molecules colliding in a single reaction step, so can be classified as <i>bimolecular</i> (indicated by the 2 in the name). In many cases there is an <i>inversion of configuration</i>, meaning the halogen on the molecule being attacked repels the nucleophile and causes it to “attack” from the opposite side, leading to a flip in the stereochemical configuration from reactant to product. The S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction is also characterized by occurring in one step so contains a non-isolatable transition state. The process is illustrated below:</p>

			<p class='subtitle'>The S<sub>N</sub>1 Mechanism</p>
			<p>The S<sub>N</sub>1 Mechanism is <i>unimolecular</i>, a single molecule undergoing two steps and therefore has a <i>Rate-Determining Step</i>. This is the step with the highest energy of activation, so takes the longest to occur and dictates the speed of the overall reaction. In the S<sub>N</sub>1 mechanism, two products are formed, one product maintains its configuration (<i>retention of configuration</i>) and the other “flips” like in an S<sub>N</sub>2. Enantiomers will only occur if there is a chiral center.</p>

			<p>Sulfonate ions are the most commonly used leaving groups along with halides, and a Tosylate Group (Ts) is the most commonly used sulfonate ion. When an OH<sup>-</sup> ion is available as a leaving group, it can be replaced with an OTs<sup>-</sup> to make it more likely to separate. A <i>protic solvent</i> contains at least one hydrogen atom connected directly to an electronegative atom; they stabilize cations and anions with lones pairs and H-bonding respectively. A <i>polar aprotic solvent</i> contains no hydrogen atoms connected directly to an electronegative atom; it will stabilize cations, but not anions because it is polar enough to attack the positively charged ion, but has no hydrogens available to neutralize the negatively charged ion.</p>
