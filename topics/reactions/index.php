			<p>Mechanisms are the ways an reaction can happen. This section addresses nucleophiles, electrophiles, and the different kinds of reactions such as substitution and eliminations. </p>

			<a href='substitution'><p>Main page: Substitution Reactions</p></a>
			<p>A <i>Substitution Reaction</i> is a reaction in which one substituent group is exchanged for another. It can occur when a suitable electrophile is treated with a nucleophile. The electrophile in a substitution reaction is known as the <i>substrate</i>. Haloalkane, Alkyl Halide, and Organohalide are all names for a halogen (that can easily act as a leaving group) which is attached to an alkane; it is classified as primary, secondary, or tertiary based on number of substituents.</p>

			<a href='elimination'><p>Main page: Elimination Reactions</p></a>
			<p><i>Beta Elimination</i> or <i>1,2-Elimination</i> occurs when a proton in the beta (&beta;) position, meaning it is on the carbon adjacent to the alpha (&alpha;) carbon that the halogen is attached to, is removed together with the leaving group, causing a double bond to form between the two carbons. When the leaving group in an elimination reaction is a halide, the process is known as <i>dehydrohalogenation</i>, and when it is water, it is known as <i>dehydration</i>.</p>
