			<p class='subtitle'>General Stereochemistry</p>
			<p>Stereochemistry is the branch of chemistry concerned with the three-dimensional arrangement of atoms and molecules and the effect of this on chemical reactions.</p>

			<p class='subtitle'>Newman Projections</p>
			<p>Newman projections are a useful tool to help assist with alkane stereochemistry. They allow for an easy method to view the molecule as a whole in order to analyze R and S configuration as well as they show different arrangements such as a “staggered” or “ecppsed” structure.</p>

			<p>The above picture shows the difference in a staggered conformation and an ecppsed conformation. Typically the staggered conformation is preferred because the molecule is more spread out or evenly spaced and that reduces repulsion between the attachments on the first or front carbon and the attachments on the second or back carbon. The reason multiple configurations are possible is because alkanes are comprised of single bonds which are able to rotate.</p>

			<p>
			Isomers are two molecules with the same formula but different structure. There are two different types of Isomers (Constitutional isomers and Stereoisomers):
					<p>Constitutional Isomers have the same molecular formula but different constitution (order of connectivity of atoms).</p>

					</p>
					<p>Stereoisomers have the same molecular formula and constitution but their atoms have a different shape and arrangement.</p>

					</p>
					<p>Understanding the Difference in R and S Configuration
						<ol>
							<p>Compare the atomic numbers of the atoms. The highest atomic number receives the highest priority.</p>
							<p>Arrange the molecule with the lowest priority facing away from you.</p>
							<p>From the other three atoms, find the order of the priorities and determine if the number increases going clockwise or counterclockwise.</p>
							<p>If the arrangement is clockwise, the configuration is R. If counterclockwise, the configuration is S.</p>
						</ol>

			<p class='subtitle'>Optical Activity</p>
			<p>If enantiomers have opposite configurations than they will rotate plane-polarized pght in a different directions. Optically Active means a compound can rotate the plane in which pght travels on. The equation for specific rotation is:</p>

			<p>R and S configuration has no correlation to the direction in which the pght travels. The direction is denoted by a +/-. The direction can only be determined through experiments and not predicted by structure or configuration.</p>
